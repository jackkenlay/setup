# My AEM Practices
A file showing the tools and trinkets I use day to day to make developing AEM as smooth as possible.

## aem-front
Mostly use the plugin for cmd+e shortcuts to switch between wmcmode=disabled and edit mode.

## aemsync
Use for front-end dev, easy to install and makes front end development much easier

## Chrome shortcuts
Probably more handy for beginners since some of them (like useradmin) arnt easy to find on your own.
Using chrome I've made some shortcuts that will navigate to AEM page on that domain.
ie crx/de, useradmin, osgi services, components etc.
A handy one is the logs, if you have access to a servers page but not the terminal, then you can use the tail logs shortcut to view the logs of said server (despite not having access).

## Setup bash scripts
Setup scripts to run when i first begin work on a project.

Handy to be able to switch between projects since it 'should' close everything and restart. Handy if you're working between 2 projects day-to-day and you need to switch between AEM instances.

Handy for those of you who are lazy like me and can't be bothered tailing logs/running aem in debug mode each morning.

## Terminal setup
personally, I use git from CLI, these are the tools, colours/aliases i use. Brew.

## install package cli (WIP)
a CLI command to quickly upload and install a package, can be handy if you're AEM is often like mine and spends 10-20 minutes showing loads of installed package.

## IntelliJ plugin (WIP)
I use for creating components, more to come.

## BEM
My personal preference on naming conventions for components and how to do the LESS
Complete with the SELF operator

## Other good front end ideas
Media Queries, ie tablet, mobile and desktop. How to use them within components, camelot will be a good reference for this.

### Best practices for clientlib setup
(run by alex, ie clielib cat project.component.name)
